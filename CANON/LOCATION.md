# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** The Old Workhouse Hostel
**Type:** Historic / Budget
**Star Rating:** 3
**Price Range:** $25-$45 per night

### History
Built in 1847 as St. Leonard's Workhouse, housing Edinburgh's destitute during the Irish Famine influx. Converted to a storage facility in 1930, abandoned 1978, converted to hostel in 2004. During its workhouse years, an estimated 2,000 people died within its walls from disease, malnutrition, and abuse. Margaret Holloway, a seamstress, was allegedly bricked into a wall by the cruel overseer James McBride in 1882 for attempting to escape. Her remains were discovered during the 2004 renovation.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Victorian institutional, grey stone, narrow windows, oppressive ceilings
- **Floors:** 4 (ground + 3 upper)
- **Total beds:** 84
- **Notable features:** Original iron bars on lower windows, a sealed section in the basement, cold spots that defy explanation, the "Holloway Hallway" where her remains were found

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Harry is possessed in Room 12, but her body dies in Greyfriars Kirkyard, approximately 400 meters from the hostel. Room 12 retains the presence - cold spot persists, guests report feeling "watched."

## The City

**City:** Edinburgh
**Country:** Scotland, UK
**Population:** 527,000
**Known for:** Gothic architecture, literary heritage, haunted history, Edinburgh Fringe Festival, being "the most haunted city in Europe"

### Geography
- **Climate:** Cool maritime, frequently overcast and damp
- **Terrain:** Built on volcanic rock, dramatic hills, ancient cityscape
- **Weather during story:** Late October - cold, foggy mornings, early darkness, occasional drizzle

### Culture
- **Language(s):** English, Scots
- **Religion(s):** Historically Presbyterian, now largely secular with strong tourist-trade interest in the supernatural
- **Customs relevant to story:** Edinburgh embraces its haunted reputation - ghost tours run nightly, shops sell "spirit communication" souvenirs, the supernatural is commercialized yet locals retain genuine superstitions

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Very high - major stop on UK/Europe circuit
- **Type of tourists:** Literary tourists, ghost hunters, festival-goers, pub crawlers, history buffs
- **Danger level:** Very safe - though tourists occasionally fall off Arthur's Seat or get alcohol poisoning

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Church bells, seagulls from the Firth of Forth, Scottish accents, construction
- Afternoon: Bagpipes (buskers), tour guides with theatrical voices, trams
- Night: Pub noise, ghost tour groups screaming on cue, wind through closes and wynds
- Unique sounds: The hostel creaks constantly; Room 12 has tapping sounds at 3 AM that staff cannot explain

### Smells
- Hostel: Damp stone, cleaning supplies fighting centuries of must, occasionally lavender (no source)
- Street: Fish and chips, whisky from pubs, rain on old stone
- Specific to death location: Room 12 has a faint smell of lime mortar - the kind used for brickwork

### Textures
- Surfaces: Cold stone walls, uneven wooden floors, iron radiators that work inconsistently
- Climate feel: Damp cold that seeps into bones, the kind of cold that blankets don't quite defeat

### Tastes
- Local food: Haggis, Cullen skink, deep-fried Mars bars (tourist trap)
- Hostel offerings: Basic breakfast, partnership with local pub for discounts

### Visual Details
- Colors: Grey stone, dark wood, muted oranges from artificial light
- Light quality: Dim, insufficient, shadows in corners that shouldn't have shadows
- Distinctive visuals: Victorian photographs of workhouse inmates line the hallways - "historical ambiance"

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Douglas "Doug" Fairweather
**Description:** 58, been here since the 2004 opening, knows more than he says, has a silver flask he touches when guests ask about Room 12
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - but gives warnings in ways that sound like jokes or tour-guide patter

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Mrs. Campbell | Refuses to clean Room 12 alone, crosses herself entering |
| Security | None | Building relies on locks and "atmosphere" |
| Bar/Kitchen | Angus | Night bartender, has seen "things," won't elaborate |
| Manager | Fiona Ross | All business, dismisses supernatural claims as "brand-building" |

### Staff Knowledge
Doug knows about previous incidents - three guests have reported temporary possession symptoms since 2004. All left quickly. Harry is the first to invite it, the first to stay, and the first to die. He tried to warn her. He always tries.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Historical curiosity, ghost-hunting tourists, excited chatter about what they'll experience. Bright enough (barely) to feel safe.

### Night Vibe
The building's true nature emerges. Shadows deepen, temperature drops, guests report footsteps in empty hallways. Many sleep with lights on.

### Guest Demographics
Ghost hunting enthusiasts, history buffs, budget travelers drawn by cheap rates, YouTubers seeking content, occasionally families who didn't read the reviews

### Reputation
"Absolutely terrifying - 5 stars!" Reviews emphasize the atmosphere. Some mention feeling "off" but usually mean it as a compliment. A few mention Room 12 specifically. Occasional one-star review: "Something is genuinely wrong with this place. I left early."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Waverley Station (10-minute walk), Edinburgh Airport (tram + walk), easy bus access. Down a narrow close off the Royal Mile.

### Check-in Process
Doug takes your ID, gives a "brief" 20-minute history of the building (actually a series of coded warnings for those paying attention), assigns rooms. He pauses before handing out Room 12's key.

### Rules
- No smoking inside (outside courtyard only)
- Quiet hours 11 PM - 7 AM
- Don't open sealed basement doors
- "Please respect the history of the building" (meaning: don't antagonize what lives here)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: poor - worse near Room 12)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers
- [x] Laundry
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar (partnership with pub next door)
- [ ] Rooftop
- [x] Tours offered (nightly ghost walks)
- [x] Other: Archive room with workhouse records

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Edinburgh's South Bridge Vaults and underground city are real and famously haunted
- Victorian workhouses genuinely had appalling mortality rates
- Greyfriars Kirkyard is a real cemetery with famous ghost legends

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Treat Scottish culture with respect (not caricature)
- The supernatural tourism industry is real and locals have complex feelings about it
- Victorian poverty and workhouse conditions were genuine humanitarian catastrophes

### Sources
- Edinburgh City of the Dead ghost tours
- "The Town Below the Ground" by Jan-Andrew Henderson
- Historical records of St. Cuthbert's Workhouse
- Scottish folklore regarding possession and the "veil between worlds"
