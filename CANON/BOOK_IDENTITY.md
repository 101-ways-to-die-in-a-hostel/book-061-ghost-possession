**Title:** The Unwilling Host
**Slug:** ghost-possession
**Category:** Supernatural/Bizarre

## The Death (One Sentence)
A skeptical paranormal debunker invites a Victorian-era ghost to possess her body as a joke during a seance, only to discover the spirit has no intention of leaving and systematically shuts down her organs from within.

## Tagline
"She opened the door. It walked right in."

## Themes
1. The hubris of dismissing the unknown - satirizes aggressive atheist/skeptic culture that mocks believers
2. Loss of bodily autonomy - horror of being a passenger in your own flesh
3. The arrogance of Western rationalism when confronting ancient beliefs

## Tone Balance
- Comedy: 35% (1-100)
- Horror: 45%
- Satire: 20%

## Target Reader
Skeptics who mock ghost hunters, people who've attended seances ironically, anyone who's said "I dare you to prove you exist" to empty air.

## Comparison Titles
- "The Exorcist" meets "Penn & Teller: Bullshit!" with a backpacker twist

## Content Warnings
- Body horror (internal organ failure)
- Loss of bodily autonomy
- Seizure-like episodes
- Psychological horror (consciousness trapped in body)
